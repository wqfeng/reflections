## How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It highlights only the differences between two versions. So I can focus on the changes to find the bug.

## How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

1. It's helpful to know what's in each version.

2. It's easier to revert to an older version if it's neccessary.

## What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

### pros

+ Flexibility. I can choose what I want to commit.

### cons

+ I might forget to commit often.

## Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Code changes often makes sense with multiple files.

## How can you use the commands `git log` and `git diff` to view the history of files?

I can use `git log` to get the commit history, especially I can use 'git log --stat' to get some interesting statistics of each commit.

I can use `git diff` to compare different commits, to know what the change is.

## How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I can always revert back with `git checkout commit_id`.

## Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I will use Git to manage by code and documents.
