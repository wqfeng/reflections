## When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

1. Share project with others.
2. I can still get a copy from remote repository when my disk breaks.


## Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

It's too magic.
